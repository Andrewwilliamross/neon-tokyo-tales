# Design & Style Guide: "Jack's Meicho Shimbun"

This document outlines the complete design system, UI/UX philosophy, and content structure for the application. Its purpose is to ensure a consistent, high-quality, and immersive user experience that embodies the "Cyberpunk Tokyo Vaporwave" aesthetic.

## Part 1: Journal Entry Structure & Formatting

The journal entry is the core of the application. Its presentation must be clean, engaging, and rich with metadata.

### 1.1. Entry Fields & Display

Each entry will be displayed as a "ticket" or "report" within the UI.

*   **Title:**
    *   **Element:** `<h1>` or equivalent
    *   **Style:** Large, bold font with a subtle neon glow effect. Can use a gradient text fill (Neon Pink to Royal Blue).
*   **Entry Date (Tokyo Time):**
    *   **Element:** Small, secondary text.
    *   **Style:** Displayed prominently near the title (e.g., "July 26, 2024 - 8:15 PM JST"). Use a monospace font for the time portion.
*   **Content Body:**
    *   **Element:** Standard paragraph text.
    *   **Style:** Highly readable, off-white text on a dark background. Supports basic markdown for formatting (bold, italics, lists).
*   **Location:**
    *   **Element:** A tag-like element with a map pin icon.
    *   **Style:** `Asphalt Grey` background with `Neon Teal` text. Clickable to open an embedded map or a link to Google Maps.
*   **Mood:**
    *   **Element:** An emoji paired with descriptive text.
    *   **Style:** Displayed alongside other metadata. Example: "Mood: Excitement âœ¨"
*   **Cultural Insights:**
    *   **Element:** A distinct section, perhaps styled like a blockquote.
    *   **Style:** Italicized text, highlighted with a `Vapor Orange` left border to signify it as a special note.

### 1.2. Media Handling

Media is a first-class citizen and should be beautifully integrated.

*   **Layout:** Media should be displayed in a responsive grid or masonry layout within the entry body.
    *   **1 Image:** Full-width.
    *   **2-3 Images:** A flexible grid.
    *   **4+ Images:** A masonry layout that prevents awkward cropping.
*   **Videos:** Displayed with a custom play button overlay featuring a neon pink triangle.
*   **Captions:** Optional text displayed beneath each media item in a smaller, muted font.
*   **Preview:** Clicking on media opens a full-screen modal/lightbox viewer with a dark, blurred background, allowing the user to swipe through all media for that entry.

### 1.3. Tagging

*   **Style:** Tags are displayed as small, pill-shaped elements with a semi-transparent background and a thin neon border.
*   **Auto-tags (AI-generated):** Have a subtle AI icon (e.g., a small brain or star) to differentiate them from manually added tags.
*   **Interactivity:** Clicking a tag should navigate to a view that filters all journal entries containing that tag.

    }
    .tokyo-shimmer {

    *   **Recent Activity:** A list or grid of `RecentTickets` (journal entries), showing a truncated preview.

### 3.2. New/Edit Entry Modal
